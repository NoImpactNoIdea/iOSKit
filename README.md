iOSKit is a robust template for starting new iOS projects using UIKit. This template simplifies the process of setting up a new project by providing a well-organized structure and foundational code that does not rely on SwiftUI or Storyboards. Designed specifically for iOS 17.2 and built with Swift 5, iOSKit offers a streamlined approach to kickstart your development.

## Features

- **UIKit Based**: Fully utilizes UIKit for UI components, perfect for those not using SwiftUI.
- **No Storyboards**: Develop UIs programmatically without the complexity of Storyboards.
- **Clean Folder Hierarchy**: Structured to enhance organization and scalability.
- **Ready-to-use Code**: Includes basic backend functions to start your project quickly.
